# a summary about you
summary: 'In 2024, I will receive the title of management engineer, with a thesis dedicated to the implementation of a web application for real-time business data analysis using the R Shiny environment. However, as a hobby, I have begun to delve into the field of data science. I am fascinated by the world of data and its ability, combined with immense computational power, to provide us with insights about the world around us in ways previously impossible. I am amazed by the techniques of descriptive, predictive, and prescriptive analysis. I eagerly explore the latest advancements in AI and its potential, as well as the risks it carries. Data analysis brings together two aspects that greatly satisfy me: solving analytical problems and crafting stories from them. Whether its through web pages, reports, or storytelling presentations, I find joy in transforming analytical solutions into narratives. Except my proffessional path, I am a passionate enthusiast of philosophy, particularly fascinated by the philosophical traditions of the Far East. However, I also appreciate the great thinkers of Europe and America. This passion is closely tied to my love for fiction, as I find myself immersed in the novels of Dostoevsky, Ayn Rand, and Leo Tolstoy during my free time. In addition to escaping into the realm of fiction, I enjoy embarking on cycling expeditions, especially those that take me through forests and fields. Furthermore, in my leisure time, I take pleasure in listening to music and diving into the worlds of computer games.'
